        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon seasoning salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>4 (3/4 inch) thick pork chops</li>

        <h4>Directions:</h4>
        <h5>Step #1</h5>
        <p>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</p>
        <h5>Step #2</h5>
        <p>Combine flour, seasoning salt, salt, and pepper in a paper or plastic bag. Place pork chops in the bag and shake to coat. Shake off any excess flour.</p>
        <h5>Step #3</h5>
