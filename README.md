Recipe Project for Odin Project 


This is a project for The Odin Project where I will have to upload an HTML site for recipes. Should be fun!

Reflect:
This was a great learning experience!
Getting something on GitHub and for others to see is a great motivator to keep contributing to repos i'm finding. 
Learning how to use GitHub to host sites was interesting and i will have to keep that in the back of my mind for future projects. 

I hope you enjoy what I made :)
